This is a command line black jack game with you as the single player against the dealer.
The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate the object oriented methodology of Java and a linkedlist implementation of a stack.
This project uses three classes: 
	The Card class is a linked list node. Which contains variables for the cards suit, face, and value. As well as a reference to the next card in the stack. This class also contains the toString, getValue, and changeValue methods.
	The Deck class is a stack that contains a reference to the top card in the deck, and methods for shuffling and dealing cards.
	The Hand class contains an array of Card objects, and the hasAce, insert, toString, getTotal, and play methods.
